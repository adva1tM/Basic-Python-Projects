# Basic Python Projects
Hello, I am Adavit More from India. I created this repository on May 6, 2024. I am a beginner learning Python. This repository contains very basic Python games. The aim of making this repository was to practice Python and to push my first code on GitHub. If you are also a beginner like me, you can use this code to understand how it works.

First Game - Snake,Water,Gun.
